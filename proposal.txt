    ðŸ›‘ Proposal for Data Extraction from https://sbs.naic.org/solar-external-lookup/ ðŸ›‘ 

Hey there,

 ðŸ”¸I've just had a look at the website you mentioned and I've got good news for you: I've already implemented a script that can scrape the data you need! I did a quick test and recorded a short video of it in action, which I've attached for you to see. Right now, the data gets saved to a CSV file, but I can easily modify that to store it directly into a Google Sheets doc just as you've requested.

 ðŸ”¸The tech-stack I used is quite straightforward:
âœ…1. Python: Itâ€™s my go-to for tasks like these due to its flexibility.
âœ…2. Selenium: This lets me interact with the website as if I'm manually searching for the records you're interested in.
âœ…3. BeautifulSoup: Once I get the data, this helps me sift through it quickly and pick out what we need.
âœ…4. pandas: A powerful library that I used to structure the data and get it ready for Google Sheets.

 ðŸ”¸And just a bit about me - I mainly work in the electronic engineering field, especially around control systems, robotics, and signal processing. But I also enjoy dabbling in data scraping and have done quite a few similar tasks before. Beyond Python, I have experience with MATLAB, C++, ROS, and even designing PCBs. If you ever have projects in those domains, I'd be happy to help. 

 ðŸ”´ If everything sounds good to you, once you hire me, Iâ€™ll send you the source code along with the data in Google Sheets immediately.

 ðŸ”¸If you have any questions or need more information, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. 

 ðŸ”¸Thank you for considering my proposal, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Warm regards,
Abderahmane
