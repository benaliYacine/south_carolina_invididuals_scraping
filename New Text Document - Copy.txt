I can do this today.


     ðŸ›‘Proposal for Data Scrapper Tool Into Excel ProjectðŸ›‘

Hey there,

ðŸ”¸I hope you're doing well. Based on your requirements, you're in need of a data scraping tool that extracts specific information from ac.UK domains. I have just the right skills and experience to help you out with this.

ðŸ”¸Recently, I worked on a similar project, where I extracted data from the website at https://sbs.naic.org/solar-external-lookup/. The extracted data included details like First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Date Licensed, Lines of Authority, and other relevant info. I ensured the data was filtered to focus on individuals with a license domiciled in South Carolina. To give you a better understanding of how I accomplished it, I've attached the source code with a video of the script in action. This way, you can visualize my expertise in real-time.

ðŸ”¸The tech-stack I used for that project is:

âœ… Python: Always my first choice because of its versatility.
âœ… Selenium: Lets me engage with the website just as if I'm doing it manually.
âœ… BeautifulSoup: Aids in swiftly navigating through the data and extracting what's needed.
âœ… pandas: Helps in structuring the data, making it Excel-ready.


ðŸ”¸And just a bit about me - I mainly work in the electronic engineering field, especially around control systems, robotics, and signal processing. But I also enjoy dabbling in data scraping and have done quite a few similar tasks before. Beyond Python, I have experience with MATLAB, C++, ROS, and even designing PCBs. If you ever have projects in those domains, I'd be happy to help. 

 ðŸ”¸If you have any questions or need more information, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. 

 ðŸ”¸Thank you for considering my proposal, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Best wishes,
Abderahmane
